## SPA å’Œ MPA

### Introduction

A single-page application is a more modern approach to app development. It was used by Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. A SPA is an app that works inside a browser and doesn't require page reloading during use.

Opposite of SPA is MPA or Multi-Page Application, which reloads each time the user opens a new page in the browser.

In general, MPAs are great for massive applications as they can consist of a large number of pages that are refreshed every time the data on them is changed.

If you are still unclear what they are, you can see this [post](https://www.mindk.com/blog/single-page-applications-the-definitive-guide/) to get more details.
